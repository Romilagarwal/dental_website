well, hi myself Romil and today I want u to make a website for me . See the thing is i intend to make a website for my dad who is a dental surgeon and owns a dental clinic in India . He has asked me to make a website for him. I am a Btech Computer Science student studying in my final year, and i assured him to make a absolute banger of a site since i wanna impress him . So what i want from you is to help me design a really advanced website for me for him which 1)showcasese the basic details that any dental care website should have ,
2)along with that i want my site to have a ai chatbot for automatic replys and answer any query the patient may have and some basic things to follow pre appointment and post appointments and i also want this bot to integrate with WhatsApp api for appointment reminders .
3)i wanna have a User authentication which would allow patients to create accounts to view their appointments history and access any personalized content from there and should have the option to pay to doctor also.
4)i want a custom appointment scheduling system with the features like real time availability checking and email and sms and WhatsApp reminders and should also sync with google calendar, and should also have conflict detection as well so that no two appointments overlap
5) An admin dashboard for my dad to manage appointments and view patient requests and get the patient details and what he did the last time if he/she is a repeating patient , also to update the website content if my dad wants
6) a payment integration where patients can pay for the services he choose to opt showing options like either upi,net banking , credit or debit card and or he would choose to pay with cash
7) a blog section where my dad can share some dental tips and any news and updates or any advice
8) the website should be SEO optimized and should have optimized page speed and should automatically generate sitemap
9) should have some interactive 3D treatment visualizers and some animations as well
10) the website should get a >90 lighthouse score
11)Implement HIPAA-compliant forms using AES-256 encryption,Regular security audits with OWASP ZAP
12) use docker , implement dark mode as well , add pwa if possible . setup some automated testing with the help of Jest+ Testing library

Now to the technical part:-

Frontend

- Framework: React.js/Next.js (SSR/SSG for SEO + dynamic features)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI (modular, responsive design)
- State Management: Zustand/Jotai (lightweight alternative to Redux) or use redux or Context api for managing global state
- Animation: Framer Motion (interactive UI elements)

Backend

- CMS: Strapi (self-hosted, headless CMS for content/blog management)
- API: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI (REST/GraphQL endpoints)
- Database: PostgreSQL (relational) or Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)
- Auth: NextAuth.js/Firebase Auth (patient portal integration)

DevOps

- Deployment: Vercel (Next.js) + Railway (backend)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (automated testing/deployment)
- Monitoring: Sentry (error tracking) + Plausible (privacy-focused analytics)

1)Use hugging face transformers for FAQ automation
2)the 3D treatment visualization should be build with three.js or react-three-fiber and use cad models for including some dental procedures and use WebGL animations
3)use graph algorithms for conflict detection in appointment scheduling
4) have next.js image optimization and have dynamic imports for heavy modules and redis caching for frequent queries for better performance
5) the site should have proper security features to prevent any data breach and maintain patient privacy
6) automatically generate sitemap with next-sitemap and use schema markup for local seo
7) use firebase authentication, Auth) or JWT for user authentication
8)use twilio for sms and nodemailer for email remindes
9) use react admin or material-UI for admin panel
10)use google lighthouse for me to audit my website's performance
11) integrate google analytics or Mixpanel for me to tract the user behavior and use Hotjar for heatmaps and user session recordings
12) use figma or Adobe XD to create wireframes and mockups
13) create apis for everything like appointment booking , contact forms etc and connect the
backend with database
14) test the website using Jest or Pytest and also perform end-to-end testing using cypress and selenium
15) setup CI/CD pipeline
16) use tools like sentry for error tracking
